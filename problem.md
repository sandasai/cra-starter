Project 1 - Star Wars Cosplay
Objective:
Your friends are about to make some Star Wars costumes for Comic Con (because conferences still totally exist) and want to find which characters would be best-suited for cosplay. Since dressing up isn’t your thing, you offered to help out by writing a program that:

1) Queries the Star Wars API (https://swapi.dev/)

- Add all persons X

2) Allows for input to filter the results down to specific characters based on attributes (gender: male and height: 6’3”)

- Filter for more attributes X
- Filter attributes dynamically X
- Required vs Not required inputs X
- Values for select options are generated from data set OR string comparison with text field

3) Displays the results in a tabular format that are decently close to what the user requested (height 6’1” - 6’5”)

- Style tabluar format better X

Constraints:

A) Your friend’s internet connection is unreliable and very costly. When he runs the program, it should never download the same data twice.

Guidance:
* Be mindful of your time and have a program that achieves as much of the objective as possible before our time expires.
* Please think aloud.
* Feel free to ask any questions you may have.
* Your final code and architecture should be reflective of your seniority level.
* If you know how to do something in another language, but don’t know how to do it in TypeScript, describe how you would do it in another language and your interview will try to help you translate it to TypeScript.
